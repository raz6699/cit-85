      <h1>History of chess</h1>
      <p>
        The history of chess can be traced back nearly 1500 years to its
        earliest known predecessor, called chaturanga, in India; its prehistory
        is the subject of speculation. From India it spread to Persia. Following
        the Arab invasion and conquest of Persia, chess was taken up by the
        Muslim world and subsequently spread to southern Europe. The game
        evolved roughly into its current form by about 1500 CE.

        "Romantic chess" was the predominant playing style from the late 18th
        century to the 1880s.[1] Chess games of this period emphasized quick,
        tactical maneuvers rather than long-term strategic planning.[1] The
        Romantic era of play was followed by the Scientific, Hypermodern, and
        New Dynamism eras.[1] In the second half of the 19th century, modern
        chess tournament play began, and the first official World Chess
        Championship was held in 1886. The 20th century saw great leaps forward
        in chess theory and the establishment of the World Chess Federation. In
        1997, an IBM supercomputer beat Garry Kasparov, the then world chess
        champion, in the famous Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov match, ushering
        the game into an era of computer domination. Since then, computer
        analysis – which originated in the 1970s with the first programmed chess
        games on the market – has contributed to much of the development in
        chess theory and has become an important part of preparation in
        professional human chess. Later developments in the 21st century made
        the use of computer analysis far surpassing the ability of any human
        player accessible to the public. Online gaming, which first appeared in
        the mid-1990s, also became popular in the 21st century.
