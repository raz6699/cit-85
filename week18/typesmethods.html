                Noise pollution isn't just annoying: it can cause deafness,
                fatigue, and even psychological problems. If you want to cut
                back on the noise pollution in your life, work on eliminating
                loud sounds made by machines both inside and outside your house.
                If necessary, sound-proof your home so you can get some peace
                and quiet. Taking measures to prevent noise pollution will help
                you and your family feel happier and healthier.

                Light pollution receives far less attention than other forms of
                pollution, but negatively affects the environment in similar
                ways, shrouding the stars from our eyes at night, disrupting the
                migration patterns of birds, and confusing sea turtle hatchlings
                making their way to the ocean. Luckily, light pollution is
                reversible. Take action to rein in your own light practices and
                spread the word to others.

                Climate change is the greatest challenge facing the world.
                Climate related disaster in the past years according to the
                research of plastic pollution, garbage patches and smog. For
                example: smog is formed when industrial emissions from power
                plants, factories, car and other sources react with heat and
                sunlight in the atmosphere. We have to protect from storm drains
                could end up in our drinking water when you pollute, we become
                part of a cycle that harms the entire community for that we have
                to pay attention when we use: Trash and litter, Motor oil, Paint
                Thinner, Fertilizer, Pesticides, garden and household chemical
                should never be washed into the storm drain system.

                Despite increasingly aggressive fresh, clean air standards in
                many parts of the state, Fresno air quality is still lagging
                behind in terms of pollution, particularly, air pollution. This
                region is surrounded by mountain ranges and acts as a pool of
                emissions, trapped in the valley by warm air that comes from its
                roughly 3.5 million residents.
