        <h2>What is Pollution Prevention?</h2>
        <p>
          Pollution prevention (P2) is any practice that reduces, eliminates, or
          prevents pollution at its source. P2, also known as "source
          reduction," is the ounce-of-prevention approach to waste management.
          Reducing the amount of pollution produced means less waste to control,
          treat, or dispose of. Less pollution means less hazards posed to
          public health and the environment.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is Pollution Prevention Important?</h2>
        <p>
          Pollution prevention reduces both financial costs (waste management
          and cleanup) and environmental costs (health problems and
          environmental damage). Pollution prevention protects the environment
          by conserving and protecting natural resources while strengthening
          economic growth through more efficient production in industry and less
          need for households, businesses and communities to handle waste.
